The object of that project is a mentoring to persons that want to learn through the real devops demands, simulating requests normally made by developers and stakeholders.

That project is started due interested of @brunomello in learning more than academic tutorials on the internet and ask me a lot of stuff related.

So, let get started...

### Rules:

1. Make a fork of these project and send me a PR (Pull Request) with your ninckname in this project, I'll be watching your project;
2. I must be able to deploy your project and execute locally, then push everything that is needed.

### Real Demands:
* First day:

You have been working in startup jprangel since last year supporting an old web app but already hosted in AWS. But today is different, you're feeling the winter is coming... so during in a meeting, your CTO announces, he is starting to build an MVP, it will be a revolutionary web app, using the high technology, frameworks, languages, and paradigms of the whole internet, all the buzzwords (less ks8, he's aws fan). His first request created the CI/CD stack of the dev projects, they until is discussing dev stuff, so you have some time to learn.
